## 공통 스타일 지시문 (모든 프롬프트 앞에 붙여서 쓰세요)

```
Classic children's literature illustration in the style of 1980s Korean
illustrated classics: gouache and watercolor, bold clean outlines, saturated
but slightly muted colors, realistic human proportions with expressive faces,
19th-century French setting (1815-1833), strong light-and-shadow with lantern
and candlelight, restrained and serious mood, no text or letters in the image.
Villains and unkind characters are drawn as ordinary, good-looking people -
never grotesque, never ugly, no mean squinting eyes, no warts, no snarling
teeth, no rotten teeth, no leering. What is wrong with them shows only in what
they are doing and in their posture, never in a deformed or repulsive face.
A cruel character may be handsome; a kind one may be plain. Never use a scar,
a missing limb, a burn, fatness, thinness, age or skin as a mark of evil.
Draw the moment in motion, not a posed portrait: catch people mid-stride,
mid-swing, mid-turn, mid-shout, cloth and hair and dust still moving. Faces
are big and expressive. Pick the most interesting instant in the scene and
stage it so a child wants to look at it for a while.
No blood, no wounds and no cruelty shown: when something violent happens,
draw the moment just before or just after it instead.

## 인물 설명 (일관성을 위해 매번 붙여 넣으세요)

```
Jean Valjean: a very powerfully built man; in early chapters aged 46, close
cropped grey hair, weathered hard face, ragged brown coat; later as Monsieur
Madeleine he is neatly dressed in a plain dark coat with white hair, calm and
grave; at the end a frail old man.
Bishop Myriel: a small serene old bishop in a simple purple cassock, white
hair, gentle eyes, plain room behind him.
Javert: a tall gaunt police inspector, long grey side-whiskers, buttoned dark
blue greatcoat, low top hat, never smiling, always standing rigidly upright.
Fantine: a young woman, at first with long beautiful blonde hair and a modest
dress, later gaunt with cropped hair and a thin shawl.
Cosette (child): a thin barefoot-in-clogs girl of eight, tangled hair, torn
sackcloth dress, always carrying something too heavy for her.
Cosette (grown): a graceful young woman of seventeen in a simple pale dress.
The Thenardiers: a neat, plausible innkeeper with a ready smile, and his
brisk capable wife; both perfectly presentable people. What is wrong with
them is in what they do — the padded bill, the child sent out in the snow.
Marius: a slim serious young man of twenty in a shabby black coat.
