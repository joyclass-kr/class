# 제미나이 그림 프롬프트

각 이야기마다 그림이 **두 장**이에요 — 도입부(오프닝) 한 장, 결말/반전 장면 한 장.
특히 "결말" 그림은 이야기의 진짜 재미 포인트(트릭, 반전, 웃음 포인트)를 담고 있으니
꼭 챙겨서 넣어주세요. 아래 프롬프트를 제미나이에 그대로 넣어서 생성한 뒤,
파일명을 정확히 맞춰서 `images/` 폴더에 저장하면 자동으로 책에 나타납니다.
(그림이 없어도 책은 정상적으로 열리고, 이모지 자리표시자가 대신 보여요.)

> **한 파일 = 한 장면입니다. 앞질러 가지 마세요.**
> 파일마다 뒤에 〔이 쪽에 실린 글〕을 붙여 두었습니다. 그 쪽에 실제로 실리는 글이에요.
> 그림은 **그 글에 나오는 장면만** 그려 주세요. 다음 쪽 이야기를 미리 그리면
> 그림이 글보다 한 칸씩 밀려서 책 전체가 어긋납니다. 실제로 그런 일이 있었어요.
> 장면이 둘 적혀 있으면 둘을 **한 그림 안에** 담아 주세요. 하나만 골라 그리면 안 됩니다.

이야기 분량이 긴 경우(결말 문단이 길어서 한 페이지에 다 안 들어가는 경우) 자동으로
중간 페이지가 하나 더 생기고, 그 페이지 전용 그림(`-3.webp`)도 필요해요. 지금은
**소금을 진 당나귀**, **영리한 상인의 함정** 두 편만 해당돼요.

권장 크기: 가로 4 : 세로 3 비율, WebP. **단, 표지(`cover.webp`)만 예외 — 세로 2 : 3 비율로 만들어주세요.** 표지 그림칸은 책을 펼쳤을 때 왼쪽 반쪽 전체를 꽉 채우는데, 그 칸 자체가 가로로 넓은 4:3이 아니라 세로로 긴 2:3 모양이에요. 4:3 가로 그림을 넣으면 화면에 꽉 채우려다 양옆이 절반 가까이 잘려나가니 꼭 세로 비율로 따로 생성해주세요. (지금 들어있는 `cover.webp`는 이미 세로 2:3이라 그대로 쓰면 됩니다.)

> **마무리 그림(`end`)은 이제 「읽고 나서」 쪽 오른쪽 위 한 자리에만 쓰입니다.** 따로 있던 마지막 쪽은 없앴어요.
> 칸은 **가로 3 : 세로 2** 그대로입니다. 적어 둔 비율대로 그리면 잘리지 않고 그대로 들어갑니다.


## 공통 스타일 지시문 (모든 프롬프트 앞에 붙여서 사용하세요)

```
A SINGLE PAINTING ONLY. This is one picture, not a page from a book.
Every surface in it is blank: no title, no caption, no signature, no page
number, no speech balloon, no sign, no label, no writing on any book, map,
paper, banner or wall. There are no letters of any alphabet anywhere in the
picture, and no borders or panels around it. The picture fills the whole
canvas edge to edge.

Children's picture book illustration in 1980s Japanese-Korean TV animation cel
style: flat clean cel shading, crisp uniform outlines, painted background art,
soft golden lighting, gentle rounded shapes, storybook atmosphere, no text or
letters in the image, consistent warm earthy color palette (parchment, gold,
terracotta, deep brown), expressive character faces, dynamic staging.
Every person in this book has a clear, even, good-looking face: smooth skin,
straight teeth, calm bright eyes, a mouth at rest - the ordinary face of a
neighbour. This holds for the cruel ones too. Draw the cruel ones as handsome,
well-kept people you would trust on sight; what is frightening about them is
only what their hands are doing and how they stand. When one of them is angry,
the mouth is open in a shout and the brows are down, and that is all.
A person's body is drawn only as the story describes it and never as a sign of
character: beauty is not goodness here, and plainness is not badness.
Draw the moment in motion, not a posed portrait: catch people mid-stride,
mid-swing, mid-turn, mid-shout, cloth and hair and dust still moving. Faces
are big and expressive. Pick the most interesting instant in the scene and
stage it so a child wants to look at it for a while.
No blood, no wounds and no cruelty shown: when something violent happens,
draw the moment just before or just after it instead.
The artwork must bleed to all four edges of the image: no white or cream
margin, no border, no frame line, no painted paper edge, no matting.
The picture fills the whole canvas corner to corner.

Once more, so it is not missed: this is one painting with NO writing in it.
No title, no caption, no signature, no page number, no letters anywhere.
