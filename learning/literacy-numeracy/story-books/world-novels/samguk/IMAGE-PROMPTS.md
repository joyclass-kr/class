# 제미나이 그림 프롬프트 — 삼국지

하나의 이야기를 열여섯 장으로 나눠 담았고, 장마다 그림이 두 장씩 들어갑니다.
그림이 있는 펼침면은 오른쪽 쪽에 그림 한 장이 들어가고, 그림이 없는 펼침면은 양쪽 쪽에 글만 들어갑니다.
아래 프롬프트를 제미나이에 넣어 생성한 뒤 파일명을 정확히 맞춰 `images/` 폴더에 넣으면 자동으로 책에 나타납니다.
(그림이 없어도 책은 정상적으로 열리고, 이모지 자리표시자가 대신 보입니다.)

권장 크기: **가로 4 : 세로 3** 비율, PNG.
그림이 칸을 꽉 채워야 하니 가장자리에 흰 여백이나 테두리를 두지 마세요. 그림이 네 변 끝까지 닿아야 합니다.

**단 표지(`cover.webp`)만 예외 — 세로 2 : 3 비율입니다.**

## 공통 스타일 지시문 (모든 프롬프트 앞에 붙여서 쓰세요)

```
A SINGLE PAINTING ONLY. This is one picture, not a page from a book.
Every surface in it is blank: no title, no caption, no signature, no page
number, no speech balloon, no sign, no label, no writing on any book, map,
paper, banner or wall. There are no letters of any alphabet anywhere in the
picture, and no borders or panels around it. The picture fills the whole
canvas edge to edge.

Classic children's literature illustration painted the way the old Korean
children's classics were painted: gouache and watercolor, bold clean outlines, realistic
proportions with expressive faces; China at the end of the Han dynasty,
around 200 CE — rammed-earth city walls with timber gate towers, tiled
courtyard halls, the Yangtze and its war junks, the loess plains of the north,
the mountain passes into Sichuan.
Han-dynasty dress: cross-collared robes, lamellar armour of iron plates laced
with cord, square-topped official caps, chariots and cavalry with ring-pommel swords
and long ji halberds. No stirrups on saddles before this era's later part.
No blood or wounds shown. No text or letters in the image.
Villains and unkind characters are drawn as ordinary, good-looking people -
never grotesque, never ugly, no mean squinting eyes, no warts, no snarling
teeth, no rotten teeth, no leering. What is wrong with them shows only in what
they are doing and in their posture, never in a deformed or repulsive face.
A cruel character may be handsome; a kind one may be plain. Never use a scar,
a missing limb, a burn, fatness, thinness, age or skin as a mark of evil.
Draw the moment in motion, not a posed portrait: catch people mid-stride,
mid-swing, mid-turn, mid-shout, cloth and hair and dust still moving. Faces
are big and expressive. Pick the most interesting instant in the scene and
stage it so a child wants to look at it for a while.
The artwork must bleed to all four edges of the image: no white or cream
margin, no border, no frame line, no painted paper edge, no matting.
The picture fills the whole canvas corner to corner.

Once more, so it is not missed: this is one painting with NO writing in it.
No title, no caption, no signature, no page number, no letters anywhere.

**후한 시대의 옷과 무기로 그려 주세요.** 이 이야기는 흔히 훨씬 나중 시대(명나라)의
옷과 갑옷으로 그려져 왔습니다. 이 책은 백구십 년쯤 전 시대 배경이 아니라
천팔백 년 전 시대 배경입니다. 갑옷은 쇠 미늘을 끈으로 엮은 것이고,
투구에 큰 깃털 장식을 달지 마세요.

**인물을 얼굴색으로 구별하지 마세요.** 관우를 붉은 얼굴로, 장비를 검은 얼굴로 그리는 것은
경극 분장에서 온 관습입니다. 이 책은 사람 얼굴로 그립니다.
관우는 수염이 아주 길고, 장비는 몸집이 크고, 유비는 귀가 크다는 정도까지만 살려 주세요.

**싸움 장면을 통쾌하게만 그리지 마세요.** 16장에서 이 소설이 이름 없는 사람들 이야기를
거의 하지 않는다고 짚었습니다. 전투 장면에는 반드시 이름 없는 병사들을 크게 넣어 주세요.

## 인물 설명 (일관성을 위해 매번 붙여 넣으세요)

Liu Bei: a man of about thirty at first and sixty at the end; long arms, large
ears, a mild face that gives little away. Plain clothes early, imperial robes late.

green robe over armour, a long-handled blade. An ordinary human skin tone.
Zhang Fei: a huge broad man with a bristling beard and a loud open face,
a long snake-headed spear. An ordinary human skin tone.

almost every room; fine dark robes, later imperial dress.
Zhuge Liang: a tall calm scholar of twenty-seven in chapter 6 and fifty-four at
the end; plain white or grey robe, a feather fan, a carriage rather than a horse.
Zhao Yun: a handsome disciplined young cavalryman in white-laced armour.
Sun Quan: a young southern ruler with a square jaw; about the same age as
Zhuge Liang.

The picture must bleed to all four edges: no white margin, no white border, no frame, no matting around the artwork. |
