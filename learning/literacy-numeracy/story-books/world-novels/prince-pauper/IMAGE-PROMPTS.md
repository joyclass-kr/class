A SINGLE PAINTING ONLY. This is one picture, not a page from a book.
Every surface in it is blank: no title, no caption, no signature, no page
number, no speech balloon, no sign, no label, no writing on any book, map,
paper, banner or wall. There are no letters of any alphabet anywhere in the
picture, and no borders or panels around it. The picture fills the whole
canvas edge to edge.

MEDIUM - this matters as much as the scene: a hand-painted illustration in
gouache and watercolour on textured paper. Visible brush strokes, washes that
pool and dry unevenly, soft painterly edges where one colour meets another,
ink line work over the paint, the grain of the paper showing through. The look
of a painted plate in an old hardbound children's classic. This is paint on
paper, not a drawing made on a screen: no flat cel shading, no even digital
fills, no glossy highlights, no animation-still look.

Every picture in this book must look as if one person painted them all on the
same day with the same brushes and the same paints: the same line weight, the
same palette, the same way of drawing a face. A character keeps the same face,
the same build, the same age and the same clothes from one picture to the
next, so a child turning the page knows at once that it is the same person.

Classic children's literature illustration painted the way the old Korean
children's classics were painted: gouache and watercolor, bold clean outlines, rich Tudor
colors, realistic proportions with expressive faces, London in 1547: narrow
timbered lanes and crowded alleys on one side, palace halls with tapestries
and torchlight on the other; ruffs, doublets and hose; dramatic light and deep
shadow; no blood or wounds shown, no text or letters in the image.
Every person in this book has a clear, even, good-looking face: smooth skin,
straight teeth, calm bright eyes, a mouth at rest - the ordinary face of a
neighbour. This holds for the cruel ones too. Draw the cruel ones as handsome,
well-kept people you would trust on sight; what is frightening about them is
only what their hands are doing and how they stand. When one of them is angry,
the mouth is open in a shout and the brows are down, and that is all.
A person's body is drawn only as the story describes it and never as a sign of
character: beauty is not goodness here, and plainness is not badness.
Draw the moment in motion, not a posed portrait: catch people mid-stride,
mid-swing, mid-turn, mid-shout, cloth and hair and dust still moving. Faces
are big and expressive. Pick the most interesting instant in the scene and
stage it so a child wants to look at it for a while.
The artwork must bleed to all four edges of the image: no white or cream
margin, no border, no frame line, no painted paper edge, no matting.
The picture fills the whole canvas corner to corner.

Once more, so it is not missed: this is one painting with NO writing in it.
No title, no caption, no signature, no page number, no letters anywhere.

**두 아이는 반드시 똑같은 얼굴로 그려 주세요.** 머리 색, 눈, 키, 이목구비가 완전히 같아야 하고,
오직 옷차림과 몸가짐만 다르게 그려 주세요. 그것이 이 이야기의 전부입니다.

## 인물 설명 (일관성을 위해 매번 붙여 넣으세요)

```
Tom Canty: a thin boy of about nine with untidy brown hair, in rags at
first, later in stiff royal clothes he plainly does not know how to wear.
Prince Edward: exactly the same face — same hair, same eyes, same height — but
upright and used to being obeyed; velvet, a gold chain, a short sword at his hip.
Miles Hendon: a tall sunburnt swordsman of about thirty in a worn but once-fine
doublet, easy-going, always with a hand near his hilt.
John Canty: a big man in a labourer's coat, an unremarkable face, a cudgel
in his hand; frightening because of what he is about to do, not how he looks.
Henry VIII: a large, heavy old king propped among cushions, richly dressed,
a tired, swollen, dignified face - a sick man who is still a king.
The Yorkshire man: a thin farmer with a quiet, steady, sorrowful face.
