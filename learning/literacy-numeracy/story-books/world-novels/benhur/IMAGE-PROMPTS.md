A SINGLE PAINTING ONLY. This is one picture, not a page from a book.
Every surface in it is blank: no title, no caption, no signature, no page
number, no speech balloon, no sign, no label, no writing on any book, map,
paper, banner or wall. There are no letters of any alphabet anywhere in the
picture, and no borders or panels around it. The picture fills the whole
canvas edge to edge.

MEDIUM - this matters as much as the scene: a hand-painted illustration in
gouache and watercolour on textured paper. Visible brush strokes, washes that
pool and dry unevenly, soft painterly edges where one colour meets another,
ink line work over the paint, the grain of the paper showing through. The look
of a painted plate in an old hardbound children's classic. This is paint on
paper, not a drawing made on a screen: no flat cel shading, no even digital
fills, no glossy highlights, no animation-still look.

Every picture in this book must look as if one person painted them all on the
same day with the same brushes and the same paints: the same line weight, the
same palette, the same way of drawing a face. A character keeps the same face,
the same build, the same age and the same clothes from one picture to the
next, so a child turning the page knows at once that it is the same person.

Classic children's literature illustration painted the way the old Korean
children's classics were painted: gouache and watercolor, bold clean outlines, realistic
proportions with expressive faces; the eastern Roman Empire around 30 CE —
Jerusalem's limestone streets and flat roofs under the Antonia fortress,
Galilean hills, the Syrian city of Antioch with colonnaded avenues, a Roman
war galley, desert camps of black goat-hair tents, and a great oval hippodrome.
Roman military kit, Judean robes and head cloths, Arab desert dress.
No blood or wounds shown. No text or letters in the image.
Every person in this book has a clear, even, good-looking face: smooth skin,
straight teeth, calm bright eyes, a mouth at rest - the ordinary face of a
neighbour. This holds for the cruel ones too. Draw the cruel ones as handsome,
well-kept people you would trust on sight; what is frightening about them is
only what their hands are doing and how they stand. When one of them is angry,
the mouth is open in a shout and the brows are down, and that is all.
A person's body is drawn only as the story describes it and never as a sign of
character: beauty is not goodness here, and plainness is not badness.
Draw the moment in motion, not a posed portrait: catch people mid-stride,
mid-swing, mid-turn, mid-shout, cloth and hair and dust still moving. Faces
are big and expressive. Pick the most interesting instant in the scene and
stage it so a child wants to look at it for a while.
The artwork must bleed to all four edges of the image: no white or cream
margin, no border, no frame line, no painted paper edge, no matting.
The picture fills the whole canvas corner to corner.

Once more, so it is not missed: this is one painting with NO writing in it.
No title, no caption, no signature, no page number, no letters anywhere.

**세 세계를 색으로 갈라 주세요.** 예루살렘은 흰 석회석과 마른 볕,
바다와 갤리선은 어둡고 축축한 갈색, 안티오키아와 경기장은 붉은빛과 금빛,
갈릴리 장면은 초록과 옅은 하늘빛입니다.

**예수를 정면으로 그리지 마세요.** 이 소설은 그 인물을 정면으로 그리지 않습니다.
3장과 11장에서만 나오는데, **뒤에서 보거나, 손만 보이거나, 얼굴이 빛에 가려지게** 그려 주세요.
그 대신 그 사람을 보는 유다의 얼굴을 크게 그려 주세요.

**병에 걸린 사람들을 흉하게 그리지 마세요.** 10장의 골짜기는 거리와 그림자로만
표현하고, 인물의 몸이나 얼굴을 자세히 그리지 마세요. 본문에서 그 시절의 무지를
짚어 두었으니, 그림도 구경거리로 만들면 안 됩니다.

**전차 경주는 이 책의 하이라이트입니다.** 9장 두 장면에 가장 공을 들여 주세요.

## 인물 설명 (일관성을 위해 매번 붙여 넣으세요)

```
Judah Ben-Hur: a Judean man — seventeen and slight in chapters 1-3, then
hardened and heavily muscled from three years at the oar, about twenty-eight
at the end; dark hair, Judean robes early, Roman dress in Rome, a plain tunic
when driving.
Messala: a Roman of the same age, handsome, polished, wearing his rank; his
face never cruel-looking, only certain.
Tirzah: Judah's younger sister, about fifteen at the start.
Judah's mother: a dignified woman of about forty-five.
Esther: a quiet young woman of about twenty with steady eyes.
Simonides: a heavy grey-bearded merchant who cannot move his limbs, always
seated in a wheeled chair, sharp-eyed.
Quintus Arrius: a weathered Roman admiral of about fifty.
Sheik Ilderim: a big cheerful Arab chieftain with a white beard.
Balthasar: a very old Egyptian, frail, gentle.
The four horses: matched Arabian bays with a white one on the left.
