ranges, Indian monasteries; and above them a heaven of jade terraces, cloud
staircases, peach orchards and cinnabar furnaces.
Tang dress: round-collared robes, monks' kasaya, court officials in silk with
long sleeves. Rich colour, gold, cloud scrollwork.
No blood or wounds shown. No text or letters in the image.
```

**손오공을 사람 얼굴의 원숭이로 그려 주세요.** 진짜 원숭이도 아니고 사람도 아닌
중간입니다. 몸은 원숭이인데 자세와 눈빛은 사람입니다. 옷을 입고 있고,
머리에 금테를 둘렀습니다. 3장부터 15장 앞까지 그 금테가 반드시 보여야 하고,
15장 마지막 그림에서만 없어야 합니다. 그것이 이 책의 마지막 한 방입니다.

**저팔계를 웃음거리로만 그리지 마세요.** 얼굴은 돼지이고 배가 나왔지만,
힘이 아주 셉니다. 싸움 장면에서는 제대로 싸우는 모습으로 그려 주세요.

**하늘을 위엄 있게만 그리지 마세요.** 이 소설은 하늘의 관리들을 우습게 그립니다.
옥황상제와 신하들의 얼굴에 당황과 곤혹을 넣어 주세요.

## 인물 설명 (일관성을 위해 매번 붙여 넣으세요)

```
Sun Wukong: a monkey the size of a small man, golden-brown fur, a sharp
intelligent face, fiery gold-rimmed eyes; a short tunic and a tiger-skin kilt,
and a thin gold band around his head. Carries an iron staff with gold caps.
Tang Sanzang (Xuanzang): a young monk with a serene, slightly helpless face,
a fine kasaya robe, riding a white horse. No weapons, no fighting stance ever.
Zhu Bajie: a pig-headed man with a big belly and a nine-toothed rake; strong
and capable in fights, lazy and hungry everywhere else.
Sha Wujing: a broad grim-faced man with a rope of skulls, a monk's staff; he
carries the entire luggage in every single picture.
The white horse: a fine white horse; in the last picture, a dragon.
The Jade Emperor: an elderly ruler on a jade throne who never looks confident.
