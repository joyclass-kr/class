A SINGLE PAINTING ONLY. This is one picture, not a page from a book.
Every surface in it is blank: no title, no caption, no signature, no page
number, no speech balloon, no sign, no label, no writing on any book, map,
paper, banner or wall. There are no letters of any alphabet anywhere in the
picture, and no borders or panels around it. The picture fills the whole
canvas edge to edge.

Classic children's literature illustration painted the way the old Korean
children's classics were painted: gouache and watercolor, bold clean outlines, accurate
animal anatomy with expressive faces; central India — the Seeonee hills, sal
and teak forest, red laterite rock, the Waingunga river, a ruined sandstone
city swallowed by fig roots; and a walled farming village of mud and thatch
with buffalo, cattle and a great banyan tree in the square.
No blood or wounds shown. No text or letters in the image.
Every person in this book has a clear, even, good-looking face: smooth skin,
straight teeth, calm bright eyes, a mouth at rest - the ordinary face of a
neighbour. This holds for the cruel ones too. Draw the cruel ones as handsome,
well-kept people you would trust on sight; what is frightening about them is
only what their hands are doing and how they stand. When one of them is angry,
the mouth is open in a shout and the brows are down, and that is all.
A person's body is drawn only as the story describes it and never as a sign of
character: beauty is not goodness here, and plainness is not badness.
Draw the moment in motion, not a posed portrait: catch people mid-stride,
mid-swing, mid-turn, mid-shout, cloth and hair and dust still moving. Faces
are big and expressive. Pick the most interesting instant in the scene and
stage it so a child wants to look at it for a while.
The artwork must bleed to all four edges of the image: no white or cream
margin, no border, no frame line, no painted paper edge, no matting.
The picture fills the whole canvas corner to corner.

Once more, so it is not missed: this is one painting with NO writing in it.
No title, no caption, no signature, no page number, no letters anywhere.
```

**마을 사람들을 무지하거나 우스꽝스럽게 그리지 마세요.**
이 마을은 밭을 갈고 물소를 치며 사는 보통 사람들의 마을입니다.
옷차림과 살림을 그 지역의 것으로 정확하게, 그리고 품위 있게 그려 주세요.
허풍을 떠는 사람은 사냥꾼 벌데오 한 사람뿐이고, 그것도 그 사람의 성격이지 마을의 성격이 아닙니다.
메수아는 아이를 잃은 어머니이고, 이 이야기에서 모글리에게 가장 다정한 사람입니다.

**짐승을 사람처럼 그리지 마세요.** 두 발로 서게 하거나 옷을 입히지 말고,
표정만 살려서 진짜 늑대, 진짜 곰, 진짜 표범으로 그려 주세요.
