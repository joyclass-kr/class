# 제미나이 그림 프롬프트 — 타임 머신

하나의 이야기를 열두 장으로 나눠 담았고, 장마다 그림이 두 장씩 들어갑니다.
그림이 있는 펼침면은 오른쪽 쪽에 그림 한 장이 들어가고, 그림이 없는 펼침면은 양쪽 쪽에 글만 들어갑니다.
아래 프롬프트를 제미나이에 넣어 생성한 뒤 파일명을 정확히 맞춰 `images/` 폴더에 넣으면 자동으로 책에 나타납니다.
(그림이 없어도 책은 정상적으로 열리고, 이모지 자리표시자가 대신 보입니다.)

권장 크기: **가로 4 : 세로 3** 비율, PNG.
그림이 칸을 꽉 채워야 하니 가장자리에 흰 여백이나 테두리를 두지 마세요. 그림이 네 변 끝까지 닿아야 합니다.

**단 표지(`cover.webp`)만 예외 — 세로 2 : 3 비율입니다.**

A SINGLE PAINTING ONLY. This is one picture, not a page from a book.
Every surface in it is blank: no title, no caption, no signature, no page
number, no speech balloon, no sign, no label, no writing on any book, map,
paper, banner or wall. There are no letters of any alphabet anywhere in the
picture, and no borders or panels around it. The picture fills the whole
canvas edge to edge.

Classic children's literature illustration painted the way the old Korean
children's classics were painted: gouache and watercolor, bold clean outlines, realistic
proportions with expressive faces. Two worlds: late-Victorian London in the
1890s — a panelled dining room with a coal fire, gaslight, a cluttered
workshop of brass, ivory and quartz; and the year 802,701 — a warm overgrown
parkland of unfamiliar flowers, huge ruined stone halls half swallowed by
green, and a weathered white sphinx on a bronze pedestal.
No blood or wounds shown. No text or letters in the image.
Villains and unkind characters are drawn as ordinary, good-looking people -
never grotesque, never ugly, no mean squinting eyes, no warts, no snarling
teeth, no rotten teeth, no leering. What is wrong with them shows only in what
they are doing and in their posture, never in a deformed or repulsive face.
A cruel character may be handsome; a kind one may be plain. Never use a scar,
a missing limb, a burn, fatness, thinness, age or skin as a mark of evil.
Draw the moment in motion, not a posed portrait: catch people mid-stride,
mid-swing, mid-turn, mid-shout, cloth and hair and dust still moving. Faces
are big and expressive. Pick the most interesting instant in the scene and
stage it so a child wants to look at it for a while.
The artwork must bleed to all four edges of the image: no white or cream
margin, no border, no frame line, no painted paper edge, no matting.
The picture fills the whole canvas corner to corner.

Once more, so it is not missed: this is one painting with NO writing in it.
No title, no caption, no signature, no page number, no letters anywhere.

**엘로이를 귀엽게만 그리지 마세요.** 예쁘고 작고 부드럽게 그리되,
그 얼굴에 **아무 생각도 담기지 않은 느낌**이 있어야 합니다. 그것이 이 책에서 제일 무서운 부분입니다.

**몰록을 괴물로 그리지 마세요.** 흰 살갗에 큰 눈, 굽은 등 — 어둠에 맞게 바뀐 사람으로 그려 주세요.
사람의 손과 사람의 얼굴이어야 합니다. 그래야 10장이 통합니다.

**빛의 방향으로 두 세계를 나눠 주세요.** 지상은 위에서 오는 밝고 따뜻한 빛,
지하와 몰록 장면은 성냥불 하나에서 오는 아래쪽 빛으로 그려 주세요.

## 인물 설명 (일관성을 위해 매번 붙여 넣으세요)

```
The Time Traveller: a wiry Englishman of about forty, pale, high forehead,
in a tweed suit; from chapter 3 onward increasingly torn, dust-covered and bruised,
his hair going grey by the end.
The dinner guests: half a dozen Victorian gentlemen in evening dress.
The Time Machine: a saddle mounted on a frame of nickel, ivory and brass with
two crystal-and-quartz bars and two small levers in front of the seat.
The Eloi: slender people about four feet tall, curling hair, delicate chins,
very large soft eyes, faces beautiful and blank; loose purple and pink tunics,
bare feet. Adults look like children.
Weena: one of the Eloi, distinguished only by always being near him and by
carrying flowers.
The Morlocks: white-skinned stooping people with colourless hair and huge
lidless eyes, human hands; they shield their faces from any light.

## 표지 · 마무리

| 파일명 | 장면 |
|---|---|
| `images/cover.webp` (세로 2:3 비율) | A tall portrait-format cover: a man on a strange brass and crystal machine mid-journey, the world around him blurred into streaks — a dark blue sky with the sun drawn as a band of fire across it, buildings rising and falling as smears on either side; his face lit and rigid. The picture must bleed to all four edges: no white margin, no white border, no frame, no matting around the artwork. |
| `images/end.webp` | An empty Victorian workshop with the doors standing open, a bare patch of floor where something heavy used to stand, dust in the light. |

## 3장 · 출발

| 파일명 | 장면 |

## 7장 · 위나

## 8장 · 우물

## 12장 · 더 먼 곳

| 파일명 | 장면 |
|---|---|
| `images/story-12-a.webp` | A cold beach under a huge dull red sun fixed low in the sky, a still oily sea, black lichen on the rocks, and one enormous crab-like shape at the water's edge; a small machine and a man on it. |
| `images/story-12-b.webp` | A dining room table with two withered flowers lying on the cloth, and a doctor holding one up to the lamp, his face changed. |
