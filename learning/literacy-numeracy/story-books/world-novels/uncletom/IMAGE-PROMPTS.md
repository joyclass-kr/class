# 제미나이 그림 프롬프트 — 톰 아저씨의 오두막

하나의 이야기를 열다섯 장으로 나눠 담았고, 장마다 그림이 두 장씩 들어갑니다.
그림이 있는 펼침면은 오른쪽 쪽에 그림 한 장이 들어가고, 그림이 없는 펼침면은 양쪽 쪽에 글만 들어갑니다.
아래 프롬프트를 제미나이에 넣어 생성한 뒤 파일명을 정확히 맞춰 `images/` 폴더에 넣으면 자동으로 책에 나타납니다.
(그림이 없어도 책은 정상적으로 열리고, 이모지 자리표시자가 대신 보입니다.)

권장 크기: **가로 4 : 세로 3** 비율, PNG.
그림이 칸을 꽉 채워야 하니 가장자리에 흰 여백이나 테두리를 두지 마세요. 그림이 네 변 끝까지 닿아야 합니다.

**단 표지(`cover.webp`)만 예외 — 세로 2 : 3 비율입니다.**

## 이 책은 그림 지시를 특히 조심해서 쓰세요

이 책은 사람을 사고팔던 시절을 다룹니다.
백여 년 동안 이 이야기를 그린 그림들 가운데 상당수가 흑인 인물을 우스꽝스럽게,
어린애처럼, 굽실거리게 그렸습니다. **그 계보를 절대 따라가지 마세요.**

지켜야 할 것:

- **모든 흑인 인물을 백인 인물과 똑같은 사실성과 존엄으로 그릴 것.** 얼굴 생김새를 과장하지 말고
  (입술·눈·코를 크게 그리는 옛 삽화 관습은 인종차별적 관습입니다), 실제 사람의 얼굴로 그릴 것.
- **톰을 늙고 순한 하인으로 그리지 마세요.** 톰은 마흔 남짓한 건장한 남자입니다.
  어깨가 넓고 손이 크고, 자세가 곧습니다. 웃는 얼굴로 굽신거리는 장면은 한 장도 없습니다.
- **눈을 아래로 깔거나 몸을 굽힌 자세를 반복하지 마세요.** 특히 11장과 13장에서
  톰은 정면으로 서서 명령을 거부하는 사람입니다.
- 등장인물의 옷은 그 시절 실제 옷 — 무명 셔츠, 두건, 앞치마, 헐거운 바지 — 로 정확하게,
  그러나 누더기 취향으로 그리지 말 것.

## 공통 스타일 지시문 (모든 프롬프트 앞에 붙여서 쓰세요)

```
A SINGLE PAINTING ONLY. This is one picture, not a page from a book.
Every surface in it is blank: no title, no caption, no signature, no page
number, no speech balloon, no sign, no label, no writing on any book, map,
paper, banner or wall. There are no letters of any alphabet anywhere in the
picture, and no borders or panels around it. The picture fills the whole
canvas edge to edge.

Classic children's literature illustration painted the way the old Korean
children's classics were painted: gouache and watercolor, bold clean outlines, realistic
proportions, individual and dignified faces for every character regardless of
race; the American South around 1850 — a Kentucky farm with a log cabin, the
frozen Ohio river, Mississippi steamboats, a grand New Orleans house with a
courtyard fountain, and a remote cotton plantation on the Red River.
Absolutely no caricature. No blood or wounds shown. No text or letters.
Every person in this book has a clear, even, good-looking face: smooth skin,
straight teeth, calm bright eyes, a mouth at rest - the ordinary face of a
neighbour. This holds for the cruel ones too. Draw the cruel ones as handsome,
well-kept people you would trust on sight; what is frightening about them is
only what their hands are doing and how they stand. When one of them is angry,
the mouth is open in a shout and the brows are down, and that is all.
A person's body is drawn only as the story describes it and never as a sign of
character: beauty is not goodness here, and plainness is not badness.
Draw the moment in motion, not a posed portrait: catch people mid-stride,
mid-swing, mid-turn, mid-shout, cloth and hair and dust still moving. Faces
are big and expressive. Pick the most interesting instant in the scene and
stage it so a child wants to look at it for a while.
The artwork must bleed to all four edges of the image: no white or cream
margin, no border, no frame line, no painted paper edge, no matting.
The picture fills the whole canvas corner to corner.

Once more, so it is not missed: this is one painting with NO writing in it.
No title, no caption, no signature, no page number, no letters anywhere.

## 인물 설명 (일관성을 위해 매번 붙여 넣으세요)

```
Tom: a Black man of about forty-five, powerfully built, broad shoulders, large
hands, a steady serious face; short hair going grey. He stands straight in
every picture. Cotton shirt and work trousers.
Chloe: his wife, a Black woman of about forty, strong, an apron, a headwrap.
Eliza: a Black woman of about twenty-five, slight, carrying a five-year-old boy.
Harry: her son, five years old.
George Shelby: a white boy of thirteen, later a young man of about twenty.
Haley: a heavy white slave trader in a loud checked waistcoat.
Augustine St. Clare: a handsome, elegant, tired-looking white man of about
forty; always at ease, never doing anything.
Eva: a white girl of six, very fair, fine-boned, in white.
Ophelia: an angular white New England woman of fifty, plain dark dress.
Topsy: a Black girl of about nine, quick, watchful, ragged clothes at first —
draw her as a real child, never as a comic figure.
Cassy: a Black woman of about forty, striking, educated bearing.
Simon Legree: a big white man in plain working clothes, an ordinary weathered
face; what is monstrous about him is in his orders and his fist, never in his
appearance. Do not make him look like a monster.
