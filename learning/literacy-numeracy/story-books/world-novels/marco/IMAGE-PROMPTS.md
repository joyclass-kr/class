A SINGLE PAINTING ONLY. This is one picture, not a page from a book.
Every surface in it is blank: no title, no caption, no signature, no page
number, no speech balloon, no sign, no label, no writing on any book, map,
paper, banner or wall. There are no letters of any alphabet anywhere in the
picture, and no borders or panels around it. The picture fills the whole
canvas edge to edge.

MEDIUM - this matters as much as the scene: a hand-painted illustration in
gouache and watercolour on textured paper. Visible brush strokes, washes that
pool and dry unevenly, soft painterly edges where one colour meets another,
ink line work over the paint, the grain of the paper showing through. The look
of a painted plate in an old hardbound children's classic. This is paint on
paper, not a drawing made on a screen: no flat cel shading, no even digital
fills, no glossy highlights, no animation-still look.

Every picture in this book must look as if one person painted them all on the
same day with the same brushes and the same paints: the same line weight, the
same palette, the same way of drawing a face. A character keeps the same face,
the same build, the same age and the same clothes from one picture to the
next, so a child turning the page knows at once that it is the same person.

Classic children's literature illustration painted the way the old Korean
children's classics were painted: gouache and watercolor, bold clean outlines, realistic
child proportions with expressive faces; the 1880s — the port and stone
alleys of Genoa; the crowded steerage deck of an emigrant steamship; the
broad new avenues of Buenos Aires; the endless flat pampas; the dry scrubland
and ox-cart trails of northern Argentina; and the Andes foothills at Salta.
Working clothes of the period. No blood or wounds shown.
No text or letters in the image.
Every person in this book has a clear, even, good-looking face: smooth skin,
straight teeth, calm bright eyes, a mouth at rest - the ordinary face of a
neighbour. This holds for the cruel ones too. Draw the cruel ones as handsome,
well-kept people you would trust on sight; what is frightening about them is
only what their hands are doing and how they stand. When one of them is angry,
the mouth is open in a shout and the brows are down, and that is all.
A person's body is drawn only as the story describes it and never as a sign of
character: beauty is not goodness here, and plainness is not badness.
Draw the moment in motion, not a posed portrait: catch people mid-stride,
mid-swing, mid-turn, mid-shout, cloth and hair and dust still moving. Faces
are big and expressive. Pick the most interesting instant in the scene and
stage it so a child wants to look at it for a while.
The artwork must bleed to all four edges of the image: no white or cream
margin, no border, no frame line, no painted paper edge, no matting.
The picture fills the whole canvas corner to corner.

Once more, so it is not missed: this is one painting with NO writing in it.
No title, no caption, no signature, no page number, no letters anywhere.

**거리감이 이 책의 전부입니다.** 장이 넘어갈 때마다 배경이 더 멀고 더 낯설어져야 합니다.
1~2장은 지중해의 돌과 붉은 기와, 3장은 좁고 어두운 배 밑바닥, 4~5장은 끝이 없는 평지,
6~8장은 마르고 뜨거운 땅과 높아지는 산. 그리고 마르코는 장마다 조금씩 더 여위고
옷이 낡아 있어야 합니다.

**가난한 이민자를 불쌍한 구경거리로 그리지 마세요.** 삼등실 사람들은 다 자기 사정이
있어서 배를 탄 사람들입니다. 얼굴에 저마다 다른 표정을 넣어 주세요.

## 인물 설명 (일관성을 위해 매번 붙여 넣으세요)

```
Marco: a thirteen-year-old Italian boy, dark hair, a serious set face; a
jacket and cap that get visibly more worn as the book goes on; one small bag.
He never begs and never looks pathetic — he looks determined and tired.
Marco's mother: a woman of about thirty-five; seen healthy in chapter 1, and
in chapters 9-11 very thin and grey, then slowly recovering.
Marco's father: a hospital worker of about forty-five, careworn.
The ox-cart drivers: weathered men of mixed Spanish, Italian and Indigenous
descent — draw them as individuals, competent and matter-of-fact.
