# 제미나이 그림 프롬프트 — 로빈슨 크루소

하나의 이야기를 열다섯 장으로 나눠 담았고, 장마다 그림이 두 장씩 들어갑니다.
그림이 있는 펼침면은 오른쪽 쪽에 그림 한 장이 들어가고, 그림이 없는 펼침면은 양쪽 쪽에 글만 들어갑니다.
아래 프롬프트를 제미나이에 넣어 생성한 뒤 파일명을 정확히 맞춰 `images/` 폴더에 넣으면 자동으로 책에 나타납니다.
(그림이 없어도 책은 정상적으로 열리고, 이모지 자리표시자가 대신 보입니다.)

## 공통 스타일 지시문 (모든 프롬프트 앞에 붙여서 쓰세요)

```
A SINGLE PAINTING ONLY. This is one picture, not a page from a book.
Every surface in it is blank: no title, no caption, no signature, no page
number, no speech balloon, no sign, no label, no writing on any book, map,
paper, banner or wall. There are no letters of any alphabet anywhere in the
picture, and no borders or panels around it. The picture fills the whole
canvas edge to edge.

MEDIUM - this matters as much as the scene: a hand-painted illustration in
gouache and watercolour on textured paper. Visible brush strokes, washes that
pool and dry unevenly, soft painterly edges where one colour meets another,
ink line work over the paint, the grain of the paper showing through. The look
of a painted plate in an old hardbound children's classic. This is paint on
paper, not a drawing made on a screen: no flat cel shading, no even digital
fills, no glossy highlights, no animation-still look.

Every picture in this book must look as if one person painted them all on the
same day with the same brushes and the same paints: the same line weight, the
same palette, the same way of drawing a face. A character keeps the same face,
the same build, the same age and the same clothes from one picture to the
next, so a child turning the page knows at once that it is the same person.

Classic children's literature illustration painted the way the old Korean
children's classics were painted: gouache and watercolor, bold clean outlines, realistic
proportions with expressive faces; a Caribbean island in the 1660s — white
sand, dense green forest, a rock cliff with a palisade of stakes in front of
it, goats, a wide empty sea on every horizon; strong tropical light and deep
shade; no text or letters in the image.
Every person in this book has a clear, even, good-looking face: smooth skin,
straight teeth, calm bright eyes, a mouth at rest - the ordinary face of a
neighbour. This holds for the cruel ones too. Draw the cruel ones as handsome,
well-kept people you would trust on sight; what is frightening about them is
only what their hands are doing and how they stand. When one of them is angry,
the mouth is open in a shout and the brows are down, and that is all.
A person's body is drawn only as the story describes it and never as a sign of
character: beauty is not goodness here, and plainness is not badness.
Draw the moment in motion, not a posed portrait: catch people mid-stride,
mid-swing, mid-turn, mid-shout, cloth and hair and dust still moving. Faces
are big and expressive. Pick the most interesting instant in the scene and
stage it so a child wants to look at it for a while.
No blood, no wounds and no cruelty shown: when something violent happens,
draw the moment just before or just after it instead.
The artwork must bleed to all four edges of the image: no white or cream
margin, no border, no frame line, no painted paper edge, no matting.
The picture fills the whole canvas corner to corner.

Once more, so it is not missed: this is one painting with NO writing in it.
No title, no caption, no signature, no page number, no letters anywhere.

Friday: a Carib man of about twenty-six, tall and straight, well-proportioned,
long straight black hair, an open intelligent face. Draw him as an equal —
never crouching at Crusoe's feet after chapter 11, never in servant's posture,
never comic, never half-dressed as a curiosity. In working scenes he is doing
the skilled work and Crusoe is watching. He wears practical clothing of his
own making.

염소 가죽을 걸치고 수염이 허리까지 내려온 사람입니다.

## 인물 설명 (일관성을 위해 매번 붙여 넣으세요)

```
Robinson Crusoe: nineteen at the start — an ordinary English youth; from
chapter 5 onward a bearded man in a goatskin jerkin and knee breeches with the
fur outward, a tall goatskin cap with a long flap at the back, a goatskin
parasol, a musket over each shoulder; by the end his beard reaches his chest.
Friday: as described above — an equal, never a servant.
Friday's father: a gaunt elderly man, dignified, weak from captivity.
The parrot: a green parrot that appears from chapter 8 on.
