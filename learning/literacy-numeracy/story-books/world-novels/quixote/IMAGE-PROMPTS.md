## 공통 스타일 지시문 (모든 프롬프트 앞에 붙여서 쓰세요)

```
A SINGLE PAINTING ONLY. This is one picture, not a page from a book.
Every surface in it is blank: no title, no caption, no signature, no page
number, no speech balloon, no sign, no label, no writing on any book, map,
paper, banner or wall. There are no letters of any alphabet anywhere in the
picture, and no borders or panels around it. The picture fills the whole
canvas edge to edge.

Classic children's literature illustration painted the way the old Korean
children's classics were painted: gouache and watercolor, bold clean outlines, realistic
proportions with expressive faces; central Spain around 1600 — the bare
sunbaked plain of La Mancha, rows of white windmills on low ridges, dusty
cart roads, whitewashed inns with a courtyard and a well, olive trees, sheep;
and by contrast a rich ducal palace with tapestries and liveried servants.
Warm ochre, dust, hard shadows. No text or letters in the image.
Villains and unkind characters are drawn as ordinary, good-looking people -
never grotesque, never ugly, no mean squinting eyes, no warts, no snarling
teeth, no rotten teeth, no leering. What is wrong with them shows only in what
they are doing and in their posture, never in a deformed or repulsive face.
A cruel character may be handsome; a kind one may be plain. Never use a scar,
a missing limb, a burn, fatness, thinness, age or skin as a mark of evil.
Draw the moment in motion, not a posed portrait: catch people mid-stride,
mid-swing, mid-turn, mid-shout, cloth and hair and dust still moving. Faces
are big and expressive. Pick the most interesting instant in the scene and
stage it so a child wants to look at it for a while.
No blood, no wounds and no cruelty shown: when something violent happens,
draw the moment just before or just after it instead.
The artwork must bleed to all four edges of the image: no white or cream
margin, no border, no frame line, no painted paper edge, no matting.
The picture fills the whole canvas corner to corner.

Once more, so it is not missed: this is one painting with NO writing in it.
No title, no caption, no signature, no page number, no letters anywhere.

**돈키호테를 우스꽝스러운 캐리커처로 그리지 마세요.**
비쩍 마르고 나이 든 사람인 것은 맞지만, 얼굴은 늘 진지하고 위엄이 있어야 합니다.
우스운 것은 그 사람의 얼굴이 아니라 그 사람이 처한 상황입니다.
특히 12장 이후에는 그 얼굴에 지친 기색이 보여야 합니다.

**12장 공작의 성 장면은 웃기게만 그리지 마세요.**
장난을 꾸미는 사람들의 얼굴에서 즐거움이 보이되, 그림 전체는 조금 차갑게 그려 주세요.
이 대목부터 독자가 웃다가 멈추게 되는 것이 이 책의 핵심입니다.

## 인물 설명 (일관성을 위해 매번 붙여 넣으세요)

```
Don Quixote (Alonso Quijano): a very tall, very thin gentleman of about fifty,
long face, grey pointed beard, deep-set serious eyes; a patched, mismatched
suit of rusty hundred-year-old armour and a cardboard-reinforced helmet;
later a brass barber's basin worn as a helmet; a long lance.
Rocinante: an old bony horse, ribs showing, standing with its head low.
Sancho Panza: a short broad peasant of about forty with a round belly, a
weather-brown face and small shrewd eyes; a grey donkey, a leather bag,
a wineskin. Draw him as a competent working man, not a fool.
The niece: a young woman of about twenty in plain household dress.
The priest and the barber: two ordinary middle-aged village men.
The Duke and Duchess: a handsome bored pair in expensive black and silver.

|---|---|
| `images/cover.webp` (세로 2:3 비율) | A tall portrait-format cover: a gaunt armoured figure on a bony horse with lance couched, charging up a bare ridge toward a row of white windmills against an enormous evening sky; far behind him a short round man on a donkey, one arm raised, shouting after him. The picture must bleed to all four edges: no white margin, no white border, no frame, no matting around the artwork. |
| `images/end.webp` | An empty bedroom at evening: a made bed, a rusty helmet on a chair, and a single lance leaning in the corner by a window that looks out on the plain. |
