명작 소설 트랙의 첫 책입니다. 하나의 이야기를 열여섯 장으로 나눠 담았고, 장마다 그림이 두 장씩(마지막 16장만 세 장) 들어갑니다.
그림이 있는 펼침면은 오른쪽 쪽에 그림 한 장이 들어가고, 그림이 없는 펼침면은 양쪽 쪽에 글만 들어갑니다.
아래 프롬프트를 제미나이에 넣어 생성한 뒤 파일명을 정확히 맞춰 `images/` 폴더에 넣으면 자동으로 책에 나타납니다.
(그림이 없어도 책은 정상적으로 열리고, 이모지 자리표시자가 대신 보입니다.)

권장 크기: **가로 4 : 세로 3** 비율, PNG.
그림이 칸을 꽉 채워야 하니 가장자리에 흰 여백이나 테두리를 두지 마세요. 그림이 네 변 끝까지 닿아야 합니다.

**단 표지(`cover.webp`)만 예외 — 세로 2 : 3 비율입니다.** 표지 그림칸은 책을 펼쳤을 때 왼쪽 반쪽 전체를 채우는데,
그 칸 자체가 가로로 넓은 4:3이 아니라 세로로 긴 2:3 모양입니다. 4:3 가로 그림을 넣으면 양옆이 절반 가까이 잘려 나갑니다.

## 공통 스타일 지시문 (모든 프롬프트 앞에 붙여서 쓰세요)

고학년용 명작 소설이라 동화 쪽보다 그림체가 조금 더 사실적입니다.

A SINGLE PAINTING ONLY. This is one picture, not a page from a book.
Every surface in it is blank: no title, no caption, no signature, no page
number, no speech balloon, no sign, no label, no writing on any book, map,
paper, banner or wall. There are no letters of any alphabet anywhere in the
picture, and no borders or panels around it. The picture fills the whole
canvas edge to edge.

MEDIUM - this matters as much as the scene: a hand-painted illustration in
gouache and watercolour on textured paper. Visible brush strokes, washes that
pool and dry unevenly, soft painterly edges where one colour meets another,
ink line work over the paint, the grain of the paper showing through. The look
of a painted plate in an old hardbound children's classic. This is paint on
paper, not a drawing made on a screen: no flat cel shading, no even digital
fills, no glossy highlights, no animation-still look.

Classic children's adventure novel illustration painted the way the old Korean
children's classics were painted: gouache and watercolor, bold clean outlines, saturated
but slightly muted colors, realistic human proportions with expressive faces,
18th-century English coastal and seafaring setting, dramatic staging and
strong light-and-shadow, no text or letters in the image.
Every person in this book has a clear, even, good-looking face: smooth skin,
straight teeth, calm bright eyes, a mouth at rest - the ordinary face of a
neighbour. This holds for the cruel ones too. Draw the cruel ones as handsome,
well-kept people you would trust on sight; what is frightening about them is
only what their hands are doing and how they stand. When one of them is angry,
the mouth is open in a shout and the brows are down, and that is all.
A person's body is drawn only as the story describes it and never as a sign of
character: beauty is not goodness here, and plainness is not badness.
Draw the moment in motion, not a posed portrait: catch people mid-stride,
mid-swing, mid-turn, mid-shout, cloth and hair and dust still moving. Faces
are big and expressive. Pick the most interesting instant in the scene and
stage it so a child wants to look at it for a while.
No blood, no wounds and no cruelty shown: when something violent happens,
draw the moment just before or just after it instead.
The artwork must bleed to all four edges of the image: no white or cream
margin, no border, no frame line, no painted paper edge, no matting.
The picture fills the whole canvas corner to corner.

Once more, so it is not missed: this is one painting with NO writing in it.
No title, no caption, no signature, no page number, no letters anywhere.

## 인물 설명 (일관성을 위해 매번 붙여 넣으세요)

```
Jim Hawkins: a lean boy of about thirteen, tousled brown hair, plain brown
waistcoat over a loose linen shirt, breeches and worn buckled shoes.
Billy Bones (the captain): a huge weather-beaten old sailor in his sixties,
tarry pigtail, an old faded sabre scar across one cheek, blue sea coat,
brass telescope under his arm.
Doctor Livesey: a neat slim gentleman, powdered white wig, black coat with a
crisp white collar, calm steady eyes.
Black Dog: a pale quiet man missing two fingers on his left hand, shabby blue
coat, cutlass at his hip; a pleasant enough face — he is dangerous because he
is calm, not because he looks it.
Blind Pew: a bent old blind man in an enormous ragged hooded sea-cloak far too
big for him, green shade over his eyes, tapping a stick.
Jim's mother: a thin tired woman in a plain apron and white cap.
Long John Silver: a very tall powerful man about fifty, LEFT LEG COMPLETELY
GONE AT THE HIP - the empty left trouser leg is pinned or folded up, there is
NO left foot, NO boot and NO wooden peg on that side. He stands and walks on
his one right leg and a wooden crutch under his left arm. This missing leg is
not a mark of evil, it is a plain fact of the story - the boy has been warned
all his life about "the one-legged sailor", so it must be plainly visible in
every picture he appears in. Broad sun-browned intelligent face, almost always
smiling. On his shoulder sits a small ALL-GREEN parrot the size of a pigeon:
green head, green face, green breast, green back, green wings, green tail.
The only colour that is not green is a narrow band of dusky red on the very
forehead just above the beak. It is a small amazon parrot, NOT a macaw: no
long tail streamers, no red face, no red breast, no blue, no yellow. If any
part of the bird below the eyes is red, it is wrong.
Squire Trelawney: a large loud red-faced gentleman in a fine coat.
Captain Smollett: a compact stern officer in a plain blue naval coat, sharp
eyes, never smiling.
Israel Hands: a lean capable sailor, quiet and watchful, an ordinary face.
Ben Gunn: a gaunt sun-blackened castaway dressed in scraps of goatskin and old
sailcloth pinned together with brass buttons and twigs, wild hair and beard.

## 표지 · 마무리

| 파일명 | 장면 |
|---|---|
| `images/cover.webp` (세로 2:3 비율) | A tall portrait-format adventure novel cover: Jim Hawkins standing on a windswept clifftop at dusk holding a rolled sea chart, the sea and a distant tall ship behind him, an old sailor's sea chest at his feet, stormy sky, dramatic and inviting adventure-book cover composition. The picture must bleed to all four edges: no white margin, no white border, no frame, no matting around the artwork. |
| `images/end.webp` | A brass ship's compass and a folded old sea chart lying on weathered planking, warm lantern light, quiet closing mood. The chart is blank coastline and soundings only - absolutely NO lettering, NO place names, NO numbers, NO book titles, NO writing of any kind anywhere in the picture. No weapons. |
