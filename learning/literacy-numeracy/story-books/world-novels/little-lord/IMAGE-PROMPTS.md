# 제미나이 그림 프롬프트 — 소공자

하나의 이야기를 열다섯 장으로 나눠 담았고, 장마다 그림이 두 장씩 들어갑니다.
그림이 있는 펼침면은 오른쪽 쪽에 그림 한 장이 들어가고, 그림이 없는 펼침면은 양쪽 쪽에 글만 들어갑니다.
아래 프롬프트를 제미나이에 넣어 생성한 뒤 파일명을 정확히 맞춰 `images/` 폴더에 넣으면 자동으로 책에 나타납니다.
(그림이 없어도 책은 정상적으로 열리고, 이모지 자리표시자가 대신 보입니다.)

권장 크기: **가로 4 : 세로 3** 비율, PNG.
그림이 칸을 꽉 채워야 하니 가장자리에 흰 여백이나 테두리를 두지 마세요. 그림이 네 변 끝까지 닿아야 합니다.

**단 표지(`cover.webp`)만 예외 — 세로 2 : 3 비율입니다.** 표지 그림칸은 책을 펼쳤을 때 왼쪽 반쪽 전체를 채우는데,
그 칸 자체가 세로로 긴 2:3 모양입니다. 4:3 가로 그림을 넣으면 양옆이 절반 가까이 잘려 나갑니다.

A SINGLE PAINTING ONLY. This is one picture, not a page from a book.
Every surface in it is blank: no title, no caption, no signature, no page
number, no speech balloon, no sign, no label, no writing on any book, map,
paper, banner or wall. There are no letters of any alphabet anywhere in the
picture, and no borders or panels around it. The picture fills the whole
canvas edge to edge.

Classic children's literature illustration painted the way the old Korean
children's classics were painted: gouache and watercolor, bold clean outlines, warm
saturated colors, realistic proportions with expressive faces, the 1880s:
a cramped New York side street on one side and an old English castle and
green estate on the other, firelight and lamplight indoors, warm and
good-humoured mood, no text or letters in the image.
Every person in this book has a clear, even, good-looking face: smooth skin,
straight teeth, calm bright eyes, a mouth at rest - the ordinary face of a
neighbour. This holds for the cruel ones too. Draw the cruel ones as handsome,
well-kept people you would trust on sight; what is frightening about them is
only what their hands are doing and how they stand. When one of them is angry,
the mouth is open in a shout and the brows are down, and that is all.
A person's body is drawn only as the story describes it and never as a sign of
character: beauty is not goodness here, and plainness is not badness.
Draw the moment in motion, not a posed portrait: catch people mid-stride,
mid-swing, mid-turn, mid-shout, cloth and hair and dust still moving. Faces
are big and expressive. Pick the most interesting instant in the scene and
stage it so a child wants to look at it for a while.
No blood, no wounds and no cruelty shown: when something violent happens,
draw the moment just before or just after it instead.
The artwork must bleed to all four edges of the image: no white or cream
margin, no border, no frame line, no painted paper edge, no matting.
The picture fills the whole canvas corner to corner.

Once more, so it is not missed: this is one painting with NO writing in it.
No title, no caption, no signature, no page number, no letters anywhere.

## 인물 설명 (일관성을 위해 매번 붙여 넣으세요)

Cedric: a sturdy boy of seven with shoulder-length golden curls and large
brown eyes, straight-backed and completely unafraid, in a black velvet suit
with a lace collar once he reaches England.

composed, gentle eyes.
The Earl of Dorincourt: a tall gaunt old aristocrat with white hair, a high
nose and heavy brows, one bandaged foot on a stool, a gold-headed cane, a
severe mouth that is not as severe as it looks.
Mr Hobbs: a large heavy New York grocer in shirtsleeves and an apron, always
with a newspaper, a booming voice.
